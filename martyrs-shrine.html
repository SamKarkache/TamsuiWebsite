                        <p>Before Chiang Kai-shek approved the reconstruction of the Martyrs’ Shrine in December 1957, it used to be a Japanese Martyrs’ Shrine for the Taiwanese soldiers lost during the Colonial Period. After the approval of the reconstruction, the shrine was completed on March 25, 1969, and was officially reopened as the National Revolutionary Martyrs’ Shrine. It is now home to bust statues depicting notable wartime martyrs from the ROC. The shrine is dedicated to the soldiers lost during wartime during the establishment of the ROC and depicts the names of both soldiers and civilians lost. To fully walk through and appreciate the shrine, it would take about 30 minutes, except those who choose to watch the changing of the guards, which happens every hour, it might take about 1 hour. It’s highly recommended to watch the changing of the guards as it shows the dedication the guards have to their job and the respect they show towards the dead. Before entering the Martyrs’ Shrine it is recommended to read the rules to the right of the entrance. After walking down the walkway and coming up to the actual shrine it is required to remove any hats before entering, you are also asked to be silent and not take photos as this is a place to respect the dead.</p>

                        <h3>Our Thoughts</h3>
                        <p>The National Revolutionary Martyrs’ Shrine is a very impressive piece of architecture dating back to the time of Japanese rule. It’s interesting to see how they kept the old Japanese style while making it a new shrine of their own. The changing of the guards is very impressive and very cool to see and highly recommended to anyone who visits. The shrine itself provides a deep insight to a time filled with turmoil and despair. While this site does not directly relate to Chiang Kai-shek, this stop is highly recommended as it provides more understanding of Taiwan’s history and what its citizens endured for the country to be where it is now.</p>
