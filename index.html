					<p>One of Taiwan’s most notable leader, and the focus of the tourist route, is Chiang Kai-shek.
						Chiang played a crucial role in the Chinese Civil War as the leader of the Republic of China (ROC)
						and the Kuomintang nationalist party. As the Chinese civil war turned in favor of the Chinese Communist Party,
						Chiang Kai-shek and the ROC military and refugees fled to the island of Taiwan.  Chiang gathered support from
						the United States in 1955 for his fight against the CCP and is credited for saving the ROC government from complete
						eradication. The Republic of China would not exist as it does today without Chiang Kai-shek’s leadership during
						this period. As a result, many people argue that Chiang was a “saviour in the minds of the Taiwanese” as he was
						responsible for freeing the ethnically Han Chinese inhabitants of Taiwan from Japanese colonial rule along with
						saving them from communism. Perceptions of Chiang Kai-shek among Taiwan’s population are extremely polarized.
						The Kuomintang (KMT) party typically has a more sympathetic view of Chiang Kai-shek’s actions during his time as
						the leader of Taiwan. This is due to the fact that this was the political party that Chiang Kai-shek was a member
						of during his time as the leader of the Republic of China on the mainland as well as in Taiwan. The KMT maintains
						that Chiang Kai-shek did what was necessary for saving the ROC from falling to communism and maintaining order during
						a time of intense political strife. In stark contrast to the positive depiction of Chiang Kai-shek by the KMT, the
						Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is more critical of his actions. Supporters of the DPP point out atrocities committed
						by Chiang’s regime, such as the White Terror and the 228 Incident, to further the narrative that he was a brutal dictator.

					<h3>Storytelling Route Description</h3> <!-- Description -->
					<p>This tourist route follows the legacy of Chiang Kai-shek in Taipei. The duality of his legacy will be on display
						with contrasting sites that portray Chiang as the savior of Taiwan or a brutal dictator. Upon completion of the
						tourist you should be able to come to your own conclusion about Chiang Kai-shek's legacy. This route should take around
						three days to complete and is accessible via public transportation such as the Taipei MRT and busses. Interviews with experts
						will provide further insight into the visited sites and allow for an immersive experience.
