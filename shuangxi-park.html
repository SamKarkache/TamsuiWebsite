                        <p>Shuangxi Park is a beautiful park within Taipei City between 2 busy roadways, providing a nice break in the scenery. The park was a gift to Chiang Kai-shek and used to be where he would take his daily walks. The park is approximately 5 acres large and allows the locals to connect with wildlife within the city. The park is popular in mid-late spring for its lilypads that envelop the surface of the pond. During the rest of the year, the pond is easily visible and you can see the wildlife, such as fish and turtles swimming below as you walk over the bridges. Young children and their parents can often be found feeding the birds or the fish or having picnics in the pavilions placed directly over the water. The park is also a popular spot for both tourists and locals as it provides a beautiful background for photos. It is mostly handicap accessible as most of the ground is flat, except for a few bridges that require stairs. The park also has public bathrooms, drinking water, and trash cans to prevent pollution. The entrance on the side closer to the Chiang Kai-shek Shilin Residence has a cave that you can walk through, almost as if it's transporting you from the city to this beautiful park.</p>

                        <h3>Our Thoughts</h3>
                        <p>Shuangxi Park is one of the most beautiful parks weâ€™ve seen in Taiwan, even compared to other parks around the world. The difference from the busy city to being inside this park is truly impressive. The park is a nice place for a walk or a picnic, and families can be seen enjoying time together and feeding the birds and fish. Photographers and models can also be seen posing and taking photos with the beautiful scenery. If you are visiting Taipei City, this stop is a must.</p>
