                        <p>After retreating to the ROC and becoming president, Chiang Kai-shek found it difficult to entertain high-ranking officials and important guests, so he decided to build the Grand Hotel. The hotel was officially established by Madame Chiang in Taipei City in May 1953. As the first lady of the ROC, Madame Chiang was tasked with entertaining high-ranking guests and officials. Without the support and push of Madame Chiang, the Grand Hotel would not be the 5-star hotel it has always been known to be. It also has 4 restaurants within the hotel for its guests and even a FamilyMart for late-night snack runs. Located on the VF floor, there is a small historical area depicting the officials and famous stars that have stayed at the Grand Hotel. This floor is also home to the meeting rooms and banquet halls for meetings and events. There are also many shops set up on this floor for guests to enjoy during their stay.</p>

                        <h3>Our Thoughts</h3>
                        <p>The Grand Hotel was one of the most impressive buildings we have seen while in Taipei. Its Chinese palace-style architecture brings you back in time, especially upon entrance and seeing the extravagant lobby. When entering you feel as though you are being transported into a movie set. When walking around the hotel it's easy to see why this hotel was built for high-level officials and famous stars. While we were unable to stay the night, if you are in Taiwan it is highly recommended to reserve a room for even one night, as some rooms can be fairly cheap if reserved early enough.</p>
